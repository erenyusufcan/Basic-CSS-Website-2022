# Free Software Static Website (2022)

This is one of my early HTML & CSS website projects, created in 2022 using basic Notepad without using any frameworks or editors.  
It includes table layout, CSS positioning, fixed backgrounds, and simple login form styling.  
This project helped me understand the fundamentals of web layout, box model, menus, and typography.

📁 Technologies used:  
- HTML  
- CSS (static styling)  
- No JavaScript, no frameworks  

🖼 Includes images folder and CSS linked to HTML.
